Based on this article, you can dump your settings using:

dconf dump /org/gnome/terminal/ > gnome_terminal_settings_backup.txt
Reset (wipe out) the settings before loading a new one (probably not really required):

dconf reset -f /org/gnome/terminal/
Load the saved settings:

dconf load /org/gnome/terminal/ < gnome_terminal_settings_backup.txt
Disclaimer: I haven't tested the restore steps. I recommend that before the reset/load operations you back up your entire dconf database, which is stored in the single file ~/.config/dconf/user, using a simple standard filesystem copy operation (as opposed to some dconf command). In case of problem you can restore it just as easily (maybe from another terminal emulator or the Linux console).
